# Rain Target Trackers

Rain Target Trackers is a World of Warcraft addon designed to aid target coordination amongst group members. For any enemy nameplate that a group member is targetting, a token (which matches that group member's role) will be placed on top.

## Features

 - Customizable token size and rows
 - Tokens indicating role, including melee/ranged dps
 - Adjustable update interval for performance
 - Compatible with Plater

## Planned Additions

 - Additional settings for raids
 - Fully customizable tokens (class colors instead of roles, different shapes, different anchoring, etc.)
 - Additional tokens for focus targets

## Additional Notes

This addon is pretty barebones right now, but it gets its main function done, which is to make clear which adds are being targeted by your party/raid.
